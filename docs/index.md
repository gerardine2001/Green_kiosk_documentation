# Welcome to Green Kiosk (PRD Documentation)
Purpose of the project
Our product is solving a problem that is existence in the community whereby mama Mboga is facing a decline in youthful customers wanting to go shop physically.
This product is designed for both mama Mboga and the customers where the customers will be able to see the variety of mama Mboga in a certain geographical location that they are in and also have the ability to order products from Mama Mboga. Mama Mboga on the other hand will be able to see the orders made by different customers and the means of delivery the customer likes. And also, they have the ability to add on the application different products that she has, in order for the customers to view them, and make orders.
The purpose of the projects is to ensure that customers are able to get their groceries at an affordable price and for the Mama Mboga’s to be able to deliver to their customers and acquire more income than they used to before.

This product is important because it will help ease the traffic that is normally there when a customer whats certain products that Mama Mboga didn’t have or have, also the Mama Mboga wouldn’t have to always call the customers to tell them about the products that they have added on their stack.
For the customers, they will have the ability to choose different means of delivery according to their preferences.
