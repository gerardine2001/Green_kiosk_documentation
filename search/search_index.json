She faces various challenges that lead to a decline in sales. This has been brought about by her losing customers. From our research, we found out that the various reasons why a mama mboga might have a decrease in sales are: The quality of products found in online shops Competition from vegetable car vendors The emergence of e-Commerce shops that sell groceries The convenience brought about by online shops in terms of delivery. Having found out the reasons why there is decline in her sales we decided to create a solution for Mama Mboga.We are developing a mobile application that will help Mama Mboga advertise her products online in order to reach a wider market of customers.The users of the application will be able to install the application,login/create an account,see products,add to cart and then place an order where they will opt for delivery or pick-up. On the other hand Mama mboga will be able to login/create an account,view orders and update her products.
